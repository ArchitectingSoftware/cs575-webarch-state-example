# CS575 Web Architecture Example

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.7.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the angular framework, discuss modern web architectures, and show how state can be managed in angular applications.

Please note that this project was built to intentionally show both **good** and **bad** practices of state managment so that I can discusss them in class with respect to web architecture best practices.  

## Installing

After cloning from git, ensure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, and the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) utility.  To build the app you need to pull the node dependencies via `npm install`.  After that you can run the app in the development server using `ng serve`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
